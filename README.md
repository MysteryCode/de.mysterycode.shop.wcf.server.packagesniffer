# VieCode Shop: Packagesniffer-Integration
Identifier: de.mysterycode.shop.wcf.server.packagesniffer

Target: [Packagesniffer](https://packagesniffer.mysterycode.de/)


### Requirements:
- WSC 3.0.0+
- VieCode Shop 7.0.0+


### Description:
This extension serves the possibility to whitelist ip-addresses. Whitelisted servers can fetch a list of all available packages and versions when no credentials are provided while no permission to download files will be granted. Providing credentials during the request will cause the extension to be bypassed and the shop handle the request as every normal not whitelisted request.

You can ask for our ip-addresses by [mail](https://wsc.mysterycode.de/contact/) or [conversation](https://wsc.mysterycode.de/conversation-add/?userID=3).


### Updates:
You can get updates from the [release-section on GitHub](https://github.com/MysteryCode/de.mysterycode.shop.wcf.server.packagesniffer/releases) or automatically through our [updateservers](https://update.mysterycode.de/).
